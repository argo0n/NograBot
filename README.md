# NograBot (Also known as Nogra)

Discord.py bot written by Argon#0002

## What is Nogra?
Nogra is a multifunctional Discord.py Bot that was started and written by Argon since the start of January 2021. Over the past few months, its code has expanded from a few hundred lines to over 1000 lines. Many of its commands *(and on_message client events)* are written based on Argon's preferences, and while they may seem useless, it is very productive in managing a server and having fun in the long run.

## Commands

## Developers
Argon#0002

## Contributing
If you need support with the bot or would like to contribute to Nogra, shoot Argon#0002 a message.

## Hosting
Nogra is hosted on DigitalOcean, but updates are first pushed to the DigitalOcean VPS before being commited onto this repository.

## Installation
**I recommend that you do not install my version of Nogra.** It is very buggy with various areas that still have areas for improvement. MY GPU License also states that you are **not allowed to distribute closed source versions of my code** (aka reproducing it to make your own bot). You are, however, allowed to modify it and check out the code in Nogra.
To install Nogra:
  1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python, Git and Discord.py installed. You can install Discord.py by doing `pip install discord.py` in your preferred command line.
  2. Install requirements using `pip install` that are in <a href="https://github.com/argo0n/NograBot/blob/master/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>
  3. `cd` the directory where you want to copy my bot's code to.
  4. `git clone https://github.com/argo0n/NograBot/` to copy my repository to your directory.
  5. Create a environment variable called NOGRAtoken to store the token for the bot. You can do so on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html">Windows</a>, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables">Ubuntu</a>, for example.
  6. Create a file in the directory `resources\test.json` for AFK command to be used with json data.
  You may want to use a virtual environment like I used to do when Nogra was hosted locally using Anaconda to install the requirements and run the bot.
  
 ## Future Plans
 I will be improving Nogra's performance with more usage of json files and possibly databases in the future.
