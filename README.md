# NograBot (Also known as Nogra)

Discord.py bot written by Argon#0002

## What is Nogra?
Nogra is a multifunctional Discord.py Bot that was started and written by Argon since the start of January 2021. Over the past few months, its code has expanded from a few hundred lines to over 1000 lines. Many of its commands *(and on_message client events)* are written based on Argon's preferences, and while they may seem useless, it is very productive in managing a server and having fun in the long run.

## Commands

Nogra's commands/help page is shown in a separate customized help page instead of the predefined help command. This is to allow hidden administrative commands from being discorvered. 

## One funny (but simple) command

## Developers
Argon#0002

## Contributing
If you need support with the bot or would like to contribute to Nogra, shoot Argon#0002 a message.

## Hosting
Nogra is hosted on Heroku, where it connects to this repository directly. 

## Installation
**I recommend that you do not install my version of Nogra.** It is very buggy with unfinishes snippets of code that has been neglected by me while focusing on other aspects of the bot. MY GPU License also states that you are **not allowed to distribute closed source versions of my code** (aka reproducing it to make your own bot). You are, however, allowed to modify it and check out the code in Nogra.
To install Nogra:
  1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python, Git and Discord.py installed. You can install Discord.py by doing `pip install discord.py` in your preferred command line.
  2. `cd` the directory where you want to copy my bot's code to.
  3. `git clone https://github.com/argo0n/NograBot/` to copy my repository to your directory.
  You may want to use a virtual environment like I used to do when Nogra was hosted locally using Anaconda.
  
 ## Future Plans
 Currently all of Nogra's codes are on one single file, nogra.py. I soon plan to split them into cogs once I get the hang of it. I do not have any intention to make my bot wide spread.
