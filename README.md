# Nogra

Discord.py bot written by Argon#0002

## What is Nogra?
Nogra is a multifunctional Discord.py Bot that was started and written by Argon since the start of January 2021. Over the past few months, its code has expanded from a few hundred lines to over 1000 lines. Many of its commands *(and on_message client events)* are written based on Argon's preferences, and while they may seem useless, it is very productive in managing a server and having fun in the long run.
